My project is called "Student Chat" and it is a dedicated platform
students with the aim of communicating as easily as possible with each other online.
To be able to use it, each user needs an account that can be created using the "Create account" button in the main window.
The user has the possibility to communicate with others with the help of the button in the main window "Authentication" based on the email and password with which he registered.
If he has forgotten the password, he can reset the password with the help of the "I forgot the password" button, confirming some data for user verification.
If you want to close the application, you can do so using the "Exit" button in the main window.
